**Project 2a: Lexer**

This project is a Java-based application that processes input files and tokenizes the content. The project demonstrates key concepts in lexing and tokenization while building a tool that reads from a file and generates tokens like identifiers, integers, assignment symbols, and operators.

**Project 2b: Parser**

This project is a Java-based application that parses input files and checks for syntactical correctness. The Parser processes tokens generated by the Lexer and validates statements, such as assignments with expressions. The goal is to ensure the given code conforms to the SIMPLE language rules, identifying and reporting errors like missing identifiers, assignment operators, or undefined variables.

**Project 2c: Interpreter**
